- Angular is a framework for building reactive single-page web applications.
- To run a development server, run 'ng serve'
- Angular allows you to write dynamic HTML code using "components"
- Components always have html, css, and typescript files.
- Components all have a "selector" property which translates to an HTML selector
- By exporting values from the component's ts file, you can dynamically display them in the HTML using double curly brackets
    - Also known as "data-binding"
- Each component can utilize Angular modules, but they have to be declared to be used.
